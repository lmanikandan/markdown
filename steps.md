- 7000 calories =   1kg


# Goal Setting

- Write your Target weight for Every Week
- Take Before photos and Videos/Inch Measurements
- Track Strength using mobile goals.

# Macros

### Protein
```
PROTEIN = 35% of overall Calories  ===> 1 Gram of protein = 4 Calories 

35% of 2000 Calories = 700 Cal of Protein

700/4 = 175g of Protein

If we not able to consume the recommended protein, Use the following Range

BW * 1.53 - 2.2 = Protein in Grams
```

### Fat
```
FAT = 25% of overall calories  ===> 1 Gram of fat = 9 Calories

25% of 2000 Calories = 500 Cal of Fat

500/9 = 55g of Fat
```

### Carbs
```
CARBS   = 40% of overall calories ===> 1 Gram of Carbs = 4 Calories

40% of 2000 Calories = 800 Cal of Fat

800/4 = 200g of Carbs
```

### To verify your Macros Count
```
Calorie Goal = Protein + Fat + Carbs
        2000 =     700 + 500 + 800
Have Atleast 20 - 30g of Fibre
```

### Calculation for 90KG
```
Calculation for 90KG Goal: 0.9kg fat loss/week

Maintanence Calories = 90*2.2*14 2772
Deficit              = 900 per day
Net Calories         = 2772 - 900 = 1872 cal

Calories Goal        = 2100 calories and Burn 250+ calories/day

MACROS:
Protein  = 35% of 2100 = 732/4 = 183g (1g of protein = 4 Cal)
Fat      = 25% of 2100 = 525/9 = 58g  (1g of Fat     = 9 Cal)
Carbs    = 40% of 2100 = 840/4 = 210g (1g of Carbs   = 4 Cal)
```
## Result
```
Food Calories   = 2100 Cal
Protein         = 183 gram
Fat             = 58 gram
Carbs           = 210 gram
Cardio          = Burn 250/day
Weight Loss     = 0.9kg per week
```
